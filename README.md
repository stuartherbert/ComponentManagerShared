ComponentManagerShared
======================

**ComponentManagerShared** contains shared code and data used by several of phix's commands for creating and managing PHP components.

To learn more about PHP components, Google for 'Beyond Frameworks'.

System-Wide Installation
------------------------

ComponentManagerShared should be installed using the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net). This installer is the PHP community's de-facto standard for installing PHP components.

    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phix-project.org
    sudo pear install --alldeps phix/ComponentManagerShared

As A Dependency On Your Component
---------------------------------

If you are creating a component that relies on ComponentManagerShared, please make sure that you add ComponentManagerShared to your component's package.xml file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <required>
    <package>
      <name>ComponentManagerShared</name>
      <channel>pear.phix-project.org</channel>
      <min>2.0.0</min>
      <max>2.999.9999</max>
    </package>
  </required>
</dependencies>
```

Usage
-----

There is no documentation available at this time.  Please read the source code and unit tests.

Development Environment
-----------------------

If you want to patch or enhance this component, you will need to create a suitable development environment. The easiest way to do that is to install phix4componentdev:

    # phix4componentdev
    sudo apt-get install php5-xdebug
    sudo apt-get install php5-imagick
    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phix-project.org
    sudo pear -D auto_discover=1 install -Ba phix/phix4componentdev

You can then clone the git repository:

    # ComponentManagerShared
    git clone git://github.com/stuartherbert/ComponentManagerShared.git

Then, install a local copy of this component's dependencies to complete the development environment:

    # build vendor/ folder
    phing build-vendor

To make life easier for you, common tasks (such as running unit tests, generating code review analytics, and creating the PEAR package) have been automated using [phing](http://phing.info).  You'll find the automated steps inside the build.xml file that ships with the component.

Run the command 'phing' in the component's top-level folder to see the full list of available automated tasks.

To test your changes, you would do the following:

    # test changes
    phing test

    # install changes into vendor folder, for local adhoc testing
    phing pear-package
    phing install-local
    vendor/bin/phix <command>
